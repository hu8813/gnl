## Get Next Line

The get_next_line function is a C function that reads a line from a file descriptor and returns it as a null-terminated string. It is designed to be efficient and easy to use, and is often used in C programs that need to read lines of text from a file or other input source.

The get_next_line function takes one argument: a file descriptor. It then reads characters from the file descriptor until it reaches the end of the line (indicated by a newline character) or the end of the file, and stores the line in the buffer.
